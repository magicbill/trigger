# Trigger

Trigger is a modern task/job scheduler (cron replacement) written in Python.

## Features (eventually)

1. Daemon to replace cron.
2. Jobs are specified as generators that yield a datetime or timedelta for when they should run next.
3. State is saved so that Trigger can continue running generators from where they left off.
4. User-level configuration.

## Status

This is a prototype implementation. There is not yet built-in daemon functionality and the state is not currently saved. There is no advanced configuration.  To add/remove jobs, you must edit the list returned by the ```get_triggers``` function in ```samples.py```.
